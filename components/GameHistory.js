        The game first appeared in Japan in 1984 where it was given the name
        “Sudoku,” which is short for a longer expression in Japanese – “Sūji wa
        dokushin ni kagiru” – which means, “the digits are limited to one
        occurrence.” Sudoku continues to be highly popular in Japan, where
        people buy over 600,000 Sudoku magazines per month.
